In terminal (macs) or another command prompt, change directory to the folder containing towerDefenseMain.py. When in this directory enter the command: ppython towerdefenseMain.py


Enjoy the game!

note: Some versions of Panda3d will  display the healthbars inappropriately - just a gray rectangle, no red fill for the health. If this occurs, re-run the program until the red fill displays. This is an unknown bug in the panda3d community, but rarely occurs.
